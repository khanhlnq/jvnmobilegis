1. Java IDE
This project is ready for import into popular Java IDEs:
- NetBeans 5.5.x or above (with Mobility Pack)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Eclipse (with EclipseME plugin). Please refer to Project Wiki for instructions how to develop with Eclipse.
Notice: Be careful when you switch development environment, your tool may overwrite our JAD settings.

2. Without java IDE
You can also build/emulate this project without IDE, all you need are:
- A text editor
- Sun Java Wireless Toolkit. Just copy this project to "apps" folder of WTK

3. Obfuscate
To make a small size application, I recommend using Proguard to obfuscate the deployed package.

Happy developing!!!
